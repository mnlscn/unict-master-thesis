In contemporary business ecosystems where analytics-powered strategies determine competitive advantage, this Master's thesis examines the operational transformation of an innovation hub through foundational data infrastructure development. Focusing on a co-working space embarking on its digital maturation path, the research presents a practical implementation framework comprising two synergistic components: 1) developing an end-to-end AWS DataLake architecture for heterogeneous data unification, and 2) employing advanced clustering techniques to decode user behavioral patterns and optimize community engagement strategies."
