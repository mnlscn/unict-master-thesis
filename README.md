# Master's Thesis: Data-Driven Transformation in Modern Workspaces  

**Bridging Infrastructure and Insights for Community-Centric Innovation Hubs**  

---

## 📌 Context  
In today's analytics-driven business ecosystems, organizations must leverage data infrastructure to maintain competitive agility. This research explores the operational metamorphosis of a co-working space transitioning into a data-aware innovation hub.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. **Infrastructure Modernization**: Establish a unified data architecture for heterogeneous source integration  
2. **Community Intelligence**: Decode user behavioral patterns to enhance member engagement strategies  

---

## 🛠️ Technical Components  

### 🌐 **AWS DataLake Architecture**  
- **Data Unification**: Consolidated multi-format operational data streams (CRM, IoT sensors, booking systems)  
- **Pipeline Design**: End-to-end implementation from raw ingestion to analysis-ready datasets  
- **Toolchain**: AWS S3 (storage) → AWS Glue (ETL) → Athena (querying)  

### 🎯 **User Segmentation Framework**  
- **Clustering Techniques**: Applied K-Means/DBSCAN to identify latent user archetypes  
- **Behavioral Mapping**: Created multidimensional profiles spanning:  
  - Space utilization patterns  
  - Community engagement metrics  
  - Service adoption trends  

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights  
✅ **Strategic Alignment**: Technical implementation directly tied to business KPIs  
✅ **Scalability Blueprint**: Modular architecture for incremental capability expansion  
✅ **Actionable Insights**: Translated clusters into targeted community-building initiatives
